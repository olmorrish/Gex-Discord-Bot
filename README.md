# Gex-Discord-Bot
Source code for simple Discord bot that occasionally enters conversations with randomized references to '90s celebrities, similar to the video game character Gex.

<h2>About</h2>
This bot contains the source code for the Gex bot, which can be easily modified and added to. Due to server limitations, the link to the bot I personally host is not included. Hoever, the code can be used to host the bot for free on Replit, and includes code to keep the bot alive as best it can if hosted this way. 

To run the bot, be sure to include an environment variable called "envtoken" (as seen on line 82 of main.py) that corresponds to your Discord application's token.
